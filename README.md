# CBIR-siamese-cnn
Content Based Image Retrieval, otherwise known as ‘CBIR’ is a method used to extract visually similar images from a large database, based on the features of a given query image. This project explores and presents a modified approach to CBIR by using artificial neural networks, as opposed to classical computer vision techniques. The method presented here utilises a Siamese Neural Network paired with a variation of One Shot Learning, which is trained on pairs of dissimilar images in order to extract image feature vectors. Visual similarity is then deduced by utilising a distance function that compares the distance between the two feature vectors returned by the network and this will therefore provide a measure of similarity based on the image content learned by the network.
